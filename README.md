# Welcome to My Template Repository
This repository is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
Next.js is a framework for building server-rendered React applications. It offers a powerful development experience with features like automatic code splitting, dynamic imports, and hot module replacement.
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to create fast-loading, highly-readable, and fully-responsive designs. By providing a wide range of pre-defined CSS classes, it allows you to quickly build custom designs without writing any CSS yourself.
Together, Next.js and Tailwind CSS provide a powerful combination for building fast, modern, and responsive web applications.
